Subject: Don't ignore offscreen A11y elements for VoiceOver on macOS

As soon as an element moved offscreen (while still visible: true), VoiceOver couldn't focus it. So either the user had to constantly switch between scrolling and re-navigating to the content he wants to read or he might even miss additional available content.

Fixes: QTBUG-135845
